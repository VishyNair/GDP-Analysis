# GDP-Analysis
NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) is a policy think tank of the Government of India which provides strategic inputs to the central and the state governments to achieve various development goals. In the past, NITI Aayog has played an important role in initiatives such as Digital India, Atal Innovation Mission, various agricultural reforms etc. and have designed various policies in education, skill development, water management, healthcare, etc.  
The overall goal of this project is to find the focus areas which will foster economic development for their respective states. Since the most common measure of economic development is the GDP, analysing the GDP of the various states of India and suggesting ways to improve it is the aim here.
